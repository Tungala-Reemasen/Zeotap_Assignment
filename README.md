 README: eCommerce Transactions Analysis Assignment
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to uncover valuable insights, develop a customer lookalike model, and perform customer segmentation. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and clustering techniques, while delivering actionable business recommendations.
# Dataset Details
The analysis uses the following three datasets:

1. Customers.csv
CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers.
CustomerName: Name of the customer.
Region: Continent where the customer resides.
SignupDate: Date of customer signup.
2. Products.csv
ProductID: Unique identifier for products.
ProductName: Name of the product.
Category: Product category.
Price: Price of the product (in USD).
3. Transactions.csv
TransactionID: Unique identifier for transactions.
CustomerID: Customer associated with the transaction.
ProductID: Product involved in the transaction.
TransactionDate: Date of the transaction.
Quantity: Quantity purchased.
TotalValue: Total value of the transaction.
Price: Product price during the transaction.
# Tasks and Deliverables
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Merge and clean the datasets to create a unified view.
Visualize key metrics, such as revenue trends, regional contributions, and product performance.
Generate actionable insights to guide marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement strategies.
Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook with EDA code and visualizations.
PDF report summarizing business insights.
# 2. Lookalike Model
Build a machine learning model to recommend three similar customers based on profiles and transaction histories.
Use customer and product data to calculate similarity scores.
Deliverables:

Lookalike.csv: Contains similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
Jupyter Notebook with model development and results.
# 3. Customer Segmentation
Perform clustering using customer profiles and transaction data.
Evaluate clusters using metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index).
Visualize clusters and provide recommendations for targeting each segment effectively.
Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook with clustering analysis and visualizations.
Report detailing the number of clusters, DB Index value, and actionable insights.
# Key Tools and Technologies
Python Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy for data processing and cleaning.
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning and clustering.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for analysis, coding, and visualization.
# Expected Outcomes
In-depth understanding of revenue drivers, customer behavior, and sales trends.
A functional lookalike model providing meaningful customer recommendations.
Customer segments with actionable insights for targeted marketing and product strategies.
# How to Run
Clone this repository.
Install required libraries with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebooks (EDA.ipynb, Lookalike_Model.ipynb, Clustering.ipynb) to explore the analyses.
Review the generated reports for business insights and recommendations.
# Potential Applications
Optimize marketing campaigns by focusing on high-value customers.
Personalize product recommendations using the lookalike model.
